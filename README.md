# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
- client satisfaction
- competitive advantage
- resource optimization
- cost management

  managers can meet deadlines by;
  - clear project planning
  - regular monitoring
  - effective communication
  - breakdown tasks
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
- ensures financial sustainability
- improves project planning
- prevents delays and resourse shortages
- maximizes return on investment
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
- agile is iterative and incremental approach in project management. advanatages include; quick response to cange and improved team collaboration. disavantages are; less predictable and significant customer invovement.
- waterfall is a linear and sequential approach in project management. advantages are; clear structure and documentation and its easy to manage. disadvantages are; difficult to accomodate changes and testing occurs late.
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
- agile is best suited in projects that require flexibility and frequent changes. e.g game developemnet, e-commerce platforms and software startups
- waterfall is best suited in projects that have well defined and stable requirements. e.g embedded systems and hardware development and construction and infrastructure projects.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
methods include;
- automated and manual testing
- user acceptance testing
- requirement analysis and planning
- code reviews

  importance of maintaining high standards
  - enhances user satisfaction
  - maintains brand reputation
  - boosts reliability and performance

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
- helps in setting clear objectives
- improving resource allocation
- enhancing time management
- preventing scope creep
  WBS is a hierarchical breakdown of a project intp smaller tasks. its important since;
  - improves task clarity
  - enables better resource allocation
  - allows project tracking
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
- improves time management
- enhances resource allocation
- minimizes risk
- prevents delays
  gannt charts have the following importance;
  - helps to visualize the entire project
  - helps identify task dependecies
  - enhances team coordination
## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
- lack of trasparency in fund allocation
- delays in disbursements
- difficulty in tracking beneficiaries
- long queues and manual application delays

  significance
  - students and parents need a simple and fair way to apply for bursaries
  - schools need a reliable way to verify and confirm allocations
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
- provides a clear focus and purpose
- supports better testing
- improves development efficiency and saves cost
- guides system requirements and features.
## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
my bursary disbursement stsstem is an easy to use platform that simplifies hoe students apply for financial aid.instead of long queues and paper work , applicants can submit thei bursary requests online and also track their status in real time. by automating key steps we eliminate delays, reduce errors and make bursary allocation more fair and smoother.
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
online application and submission
automated eligibilty assessment
secure digital record keeping
automated fund allocation
fraud prevention and verification system
## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
identifying demand and target users
addressing competition and diffrentiation
